          What is a weapon anyway?
        </h2>

        <p>
          weapon is an instrument used in combat for the purpose of killing,
          injuring, or defeating an enemy. A weapon may be a shock weapon, held
          in the hands, such as the club, mace, or sword
        </p>

        <h3>Lets take a look at rifles</h3>
        <p>
          A rifle is a long-barrelled firearm designed for accurate shooting,
          with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into
          the bore wall. In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are
          typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly
          against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during
          shooting. Rifles are used extensively in warfare, self defense, law
          enforcement, crime (most notably assassinations), hunting, and
          shooting sports.
