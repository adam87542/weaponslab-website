    <h1>Welcome to world war II page</h1>
    <p>
      World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2,<br />
      was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast<br />
      majority of the world's countries—including all of the great<br />
      powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis<br />
      powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million
      personnel<br />
      from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire<br />
      economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war
      effort,<br />
      blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft<br />
      played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of<br />
      population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war.
      World<br />
      War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in<br />
      70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of
      millions<br />
      of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation,<br />
      massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan<br />
      were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German
      and<br />
      Japanese leaders.

    <h1>here is some of the famous weapons that were used in the war</h1>
    <h3>The Thompson submachine gun </h3>

    <p>The Thompson submachine gun 
    is a blowback-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed selective-fire submachine gun, 
    invented by the United States Army Brigadier general John T. Thompson in 1918. 
    It was originally designed to break the stalemate of trench warfare of World War I, but was not finished until after 
    the war ended. </p>

    <h3>The MP 40 </h3>

  <p>The MP 40 (Maschinenpistole 40) is a submachine gun chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. It was developed in Nazi Germany and used extensively by the Axis powers during World War II.
    it was heavily used by infantrymen (particularly platoon and squad leaders), and by paratroopers, on the Eastern and Western Fronts as well as armoured fighting vehicle crews.[5][6] Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war.</p>
    <h3>The PPSh-41</h3>

    <p>The PPSh-41  is a Soviet submachine gun designed by Georgy Shpagin as a cheap, reliable, and simplified alternative to the PPD-40.
       A common Russian nickname for the weapon is "papasha" , meaning "daddy" and it was sometimes called the "burp gun" because of its high fire-rate.
       The PPSh saw extensive combat use during World War II and the Korean War , 
       It became one of the major infantry weapons of the Soviet Armed Forces during World War II, with about six million PPSh-41s manufactured in this period, making it the most-produced submachine gun of the war.</p>
       <h3>The MP 18</h3>
       <img src="../Imgs/Mp18.png" />
       <p>The MP 18, manufactured by Theodor Bergmann Abteilung Waffenbau, was arguably the first submachine gun used in combat. It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Sturmtruppen, assault groups specialized in trench combat. Although MP 18 production ended in the 1920s, its design formed the basis of most submachine guns manufactured between 1920 and 1960.</p>
