        The Uzi is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine
        guns first designed by Major Uziel "Uzi" Gal in the late 1940s, shortly
        after the establishment of the State of Israel. It is one of the first
        weapons to incorporate a telescoping bolt design, which allows the
        magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.

        The MP5 is a 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun, developed in the 1960s by
        a team of engineers from the German small arms manufacturer Heckler &
        Koch GmbH of Oberndorf am Neckar. There are over 100 variants and
        clones of the MP5, including some semi-automatic versions.

        The MP7 is a personal defense weapon
        chambered for the HK 4.6×30mm armor-piercing cartridge designed by
        German defence manufacturer Heckler & Koch. It was designed (together
        with the new cartridge) to meet NATO requirements published in 1989,
        which called for an SMG-type weapon with a greater capacity to defeat
        Kevlar body armour

    <p>The Thompson submachine gun (also known as the "Tommy Gun", "Chicago Typewriter", "Chicago Piano", or "Trench Broom") is a blowback-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed selective-fire submachine gun, invented by the United States Army Brigadier general John T. Thompson in 1918. It was originally designed to break the stalemate of trench warfare of World War I, but was not finished until after the war ended. </p>

         <p>The MP 18, manufactured by Theodor Bergmann Abteilung Waffenbau, was arguably the first submachine gun used in combat. It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Sturmtruppen, assault groups specialized in trench combat. Although MP 18 production ended in the 1920s, its design formed the basis of most submachine guns manufactured between 1920 and 1960.</p>

             <p>The MP 40 (Maschinenpistole 40) is a submachine gun chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. It was developed in Nazi Germany and used extensively by the Axis powers during World War II.
              it was heavily used by infantrymen (particularly platoon and squad leaders), and by paratroopers, on the Eastern and Western Fronts as well as armoured fighting vehicle crews.[5][6] Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war. </p>

                 <p>The PPSh-41  is a Soviet submachine gun designed by Georgy Shpagin as a cheap, reliable, and simplified alternative to the PPD-40.
                    A common Russian nickname for the weapon is "papasha" , meaning "daddy" and it was sometimes called the "burp gun" because of its high fire-rate.
                    The PPSh saw extensive combat use during World War II and the Korean War , 
                    It became one of the major infantry weapons of the Soviet Armed Forces during World War II, with about six million PPSh-41s manufactured in this period, making it the most-produced submachine gun of the war.</p>
