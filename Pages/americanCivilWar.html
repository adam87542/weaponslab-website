    <h1>Welcome to american civil war page</h1>
    <p>
      The American Civil War, fought between the Union and Confederate
      forces,<br />
      took place from 1861 to 1865. During the war, a variety of weapons were<br />
      used on both sides. These weapons include edged weapons such as knives,<br />
      swords, and bayonets, firearms such as rifled muskets, breech-loaders
      and<br />
      repeating weapons, various artillery such as field guns and siege guns
      and<br />
      new weapons such as the early grenade and landmine. The Civil War is
      often<br />
      referred as one of the first "modern" wars in history as it included
      the<br />
      most advanced technology and innovations of warfare available at the time.

    <h1>here is some of the famous weapons that were used in the war</h1>
    <h3>Deane and Adams</h3>

      military museum Adams cal. On August 22, 1851, he was granted a British
      patent for a new revolver design. The revolver used a double-action only
      system in which the external hammer could not be cocked by thumbing it
      back, like most other pistols of the era, but instead cocked itself when
      the trigger was pulled. This made it possible to fire the gun much more
      rapidly than contemporary single-action revolvers, such as the Colt, which
      had to be cocked before each shot.

    <h3>Burnside carbine</h3>

    <p>
      The carbine was designed and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned
      his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full-time to working on
      the weapon. The carbine used a special brass cartridge which was also
      invented by Burnside. This cartridge contained a bullet and powder, but no
      primer. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block
      and allowed the user to insert a cartridge.

    <h3>Tarpley carbine</h3>

    <p>
      The Tarpley Carbine was a Confederate weapon produced and used during the
      American Civil War; however, it was not produced in great numbers. The
      Tarpley Carbine was a breechloader, and was comparable in this sense to
      the Sharps Rifle and Carbine more widely used by the Union.
