    <h1>Welcome The Korean War page</h1>
    <p>
      The Korean War was a war fought between North Korea and South Korea from
      <br />
      1950 to 1953. The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded
      South<br />
      Korea following clashes along the border and rebellions in South Korea.<br />
      North Korea was supported by China and the Soviet Union while South
      Korea<br />
      was supported by the United Nations, principally the United States. The
      fighting ended with an armistice on 27 July 1953.

    <h1>here is some of the famous weapons that were used in the war</h1>
    <h3>The M1 carbine</h3>

    <p>
      The M1 carbine (formally the United States Carbine) is a lightweight
      semi-automatic carbine that was a standard firearm for the U.S. military
      during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The M1 carbine
      was produced in several variants and was widely used by paramilitary and
      police forces around the world, and also became a popular civilian firearm
      after World War II.

    <h3>The M3</h3>

    <p>
      The M3 is an American .45-caliber submachine gun adopted for the U.S. Army
      service on 12 December 1942, as the United States Submachine Gun, The M3
      was chambered for the same .45 ACP round fired by the Thompson submachine
      gun, but was cheaper to produce and lighter, although, contrary to popular
      belief, it was less accurate.The M3 was commonly referred to as the
      "Grease Gun" or simply "the Greaser", owing to its visual similarity to
      the mechanic's tool. The M3 was intended as a replacement for the
      Thompson, and began to enter frontline service in mid-1944. The M3A1
      variant was used in the Korean War and later conflicts.

    <h3>Ithaca 37</h3>

    <p>
      The Ithaca 37 (or Model 37) is a pump-action shotgun made in large numbers
      for the civilian, military, and police markets. Based on a 1915 patent by
      firearms designer John Browning for a shotgun initially marketed as the
      Remington Model 17, it utilizes a novel combination ejection/loading port
      on the bottom of the gun which leaves the sides closed to the elements.
