    <p>
      World War I, often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, also known as the First
      <br />
      World War or the Great War, was an international conflict that began on
      28<br />
      July 1914 and ended on 11 November 1918. It involved much of Europe, as<br />
      well as Russia, the United States and Turkey, and was also fought in
      the<br />
      Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest conflicts
      in<br />
      history, an estimated 9 million were killed in combat, while over 5<br />
      million civilians died from occupation, bombardment, hunger or disease.<br />
      The genocides perpetrated by the Ottomans and the 1918 Spanish flu<br />
      pandemic spread by the movement of combatants during the war caused
      many<br />
      millions of additional deaths worldwide.<br />

    <p>
      The Mauser C96 s a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by
      German arms manufacturer Mauser from 1896 to 1937. Unlicensed copies of
      the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the
      20th century.

    <h3>Burnside carbine</h3>

    <p>
      The carbine was designed and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned
      his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full-time to working on
      the weapon. The carbine used a special brass cartridge which was also
      invented by Burnside. This cartridge contained a bullet and powder, but no
      primer. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block
      and allowed the user to insert a cartridge.
    </p>
    <h3>Tarpley carbine</h3>

    <p>
      The Tarpley Carbine was a Confederate weapon produced and used during the
      American Civil War; however, it was not produced in great numbers. The
      Tarpley Carbine was a breechloader, and was comparable in this sense to
      the Sharps Rifle and Carbine more widely used by the Union.
